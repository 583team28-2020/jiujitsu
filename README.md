- Constant propagation LLVM pass
- Dead code elimination pass
- Modify JIT to conditionally specialize functions
- Figure out how to load other dynamic libraries

To look into for next meeting (in addition to above):
  - How do we conditionally optimize JITted code?
  - How do we detect parameters for JITted functions?
  - Just in general, look into runtime optimization with LLVM JIT.
